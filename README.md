# SM-SPSA

SM-SPSA (stochastic matrix simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation) is an extension of the [SPSA algorithm](https://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA/) to optimize a nonlinear objective function over the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. For more information, please visit the SM-SPSA website: https://nanned.github.io/SM-SPSA.
