# SM-SPSA

SM-SPSA (stochastic matrix simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation) is an extension of the [SPSA algorithm](https://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA/) to optimize a nonlinear objective function over the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. For more information, please visit the SM-SPSA website: https://nanned.github.io/SM-SPSA.

The code is written in Python 3.10.4.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to ``SM-SPSA`` in any way, please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/NanneD/SM-SPSA/issues) to discuss what you would like to add or change. Moreover, make sure that your code submission includes:
- tests
- type hints
- documentation
- docstrings for the added/changed methods, classes, etc. according to the NumPy docstrings format

To check whether the type hints and tests run smoothly, you can follow these steps:
1. Open the command line and move to the ``SMSPSA`` folder.
2. Run the tests by using the following command:
```
pytest smspsa/tests.py
```
3. Run the mypy checker by using:
```
mypy smspsa/
```
