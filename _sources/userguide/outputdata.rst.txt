Output data
===========

The SM-SPSA algorithm can also provide different types of output data. You can specify which data is provided and/or saved by setting several variables that can be found in ``smspsa/main.py``. The "normal" and "memory optimised" versions of the algorithm provide different types of output data, although both can provide a running time table and run parameter overviews. The output data is discussed in separate sections.
